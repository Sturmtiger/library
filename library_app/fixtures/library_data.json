      "biography": "Stephen King was born September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. His father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King.[11][12][13] Stephen's mother was Nellie Ruth (n\u00e9e Pillsbury).[13] The two were married on July 23, 1939, in Scarborough, Maine.[14] Shortly afterwards, they lived with Donald's family in Chicago, then moved to Croton-on-Hudson, New York.[15]\r\n\r\nThe Kings returned to Maine towards the end of World War II, living in a modest house in Scarborough. When King was two years old, his father left the family. King's mother raised Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved from Scarborough, depending on relatives in Chicago; Croton-on-Hudson; West De Pere, Wisconsin; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Malden, Massachusetts; and Stratford, Connecticut.[16][17] When King was 11, his family returned to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged.[1] King was raised Methodist[18] but lost his belief in organized religion while in high school. While no longer religious, King chooses to believe in the existence of God.[19]\r\n\r\nAs a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works,[20] but King makes no mention of it in his memoir On Writing (2000).\r\n\r\nKing related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (1981), in a chapter titled \"An Annoying Autobiographical Pause.\" King compares his uncle's dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as The Lurker in the Shadows, that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, \"I knew that I'd found home when I read that book.\"[21]\r\n\r\nKing attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School, in Lisbon Falls, Maine in 1966.[22] He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC's horror comics, including Tales from the Crypt (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for Creepshow). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to Dave's Rag, the newspaper his brother published with a mimeograph machine, and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber\"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a fanzine, Comics Review, in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as \"In a Half-World of Terror\" in another fanzine, Stories of Suspense, edited by Marv Wolfman.[23] As a teen, King also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[24]\r\n\r\nFrom 1966, King studied at the University of Maine, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.[25] That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, Steve King's Garbage Truck, for the student newspaper, The Maine Campus, and participated in a writing workshop organized by Burton Hatlen.[26] King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry. King met his future wife, fellow student Tabitha Spruce, at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops; they wed in 1971.[26]",

      "biography": "Lem was born in 1921 in Lw\u00f3w, interwar Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine) to a family of Jewish origin. According to his own account, he was actually born on the 13th of September, but the date was changed to the 12th on his birth certificate because of superstition.[8] He was the son of Sabina n\u00e9e Woller (1892\u20131979) and Samuel Lem (1879\u20131954), a wealthy laryngologist and former physician in the Austro-Hungarian Army,[9][10] and first cousin to Polish poet Marian Hemar (Lem's father's sister's son).[11] In later years Lem sometimes claimed to have been raised Roman Catholic, but he went to Jewish religious lessons during his school years.[2] He later became an atheist \"for moral reasons ... the world appears to me to be put together in such a painful way that I prefer to believe that it was not created ... intentionally\".[12][13] In later years he would call himself both an agnostic[14] and an atheist.[15]\r\n\r\nAfter the Soviet invasion and occupation of Eastern Poland, he was not allowed to study at Lwow Polytechnic as he wished because of his \"bourgeois origin\", and only due to his father's connections was accepted to study medicine at Lw\u00f3w University in 1940.[16] During the subsequent Nazi occupation (1941\u20131944), Lem's family, which had Jewish roots, avoided imprisonment in a ghetto, surviving with false papers.[10] He would later recall:[10][17]\r\n\r\n    During that period, I learned in a very personal, practical way that I was no \"Aryan\". I knew that my ancestors were Jews, but I knew nothing of the Mosaic faith and, regrettably, nothing at all of Jewish culture. So it was, strictly speaking, only the Nazi legislation that brought home to me the realization that I had Jewish blood in my veins. \r\n\r\nDuring that time, Lem earned a living as a car mechanic and welder,[10] and occasionally stole munitions from storehouses (to which he had access as an employee of a German company) to pass them on to the Polish resistance.[18]\r\n\r\nIn 1945, the Polish Eastern Borderlands were annexed into Soviet Ukraine, and the family, along with many other Poles, was resettled to Krak\u00f3w, where Lem, at his father's insistence, took up medical studies at the Jagiellonian University.[10] He did not take his final examinations on purpose, to avoid the career of military doctor, which he suspected could have become lifelong.[19][16] After receiving absolutorium (Polish term for the evidence of completion of the studies without diploma), he did an obligatory monthly work at a hospital, at a maternity ward, where he assisted at a number of childbirths and a caesarean section. Lem said that the sight of blood was one of the reasons he decided to drop medicine.[20]",
